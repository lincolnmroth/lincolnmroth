### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Lincoln, a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student interested in all things making/hacking, especially anything robotics related. I am currently working on control systems for EUV lithography systems as a Mechatronics Intern at ASML. I also enjoy working on a lot of random hardware projects, so feel free to check some of them out [here](https://lincolnroth.com).

Last summer, I worked on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython) and [Glider](https://github.com/adafruit/Glider) through the MLH Fellowship program. 

I'm always interested in new opportunities, so if you want to reach me you can shoot me an email at [hi@lincolnroth.com](mailto:hi@lincolnroth.com) or message me through my [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincoln-roth/)
