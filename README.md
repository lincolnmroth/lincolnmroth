### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lincoln, a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student interested in all things making/hacking, especially anything robotics related. This past summer, I worked on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython) and [Glider](https://github.com/adafruit/Glider) through the MLH Fellowship program. Right now I'm mainly focusing on hardware projects (specifically torque driven actuators and a quadrupedal robot), so if you're interested, go check out my website [here](https://lincolnroth.com)!

I'm always interested in new opportunities, so if you want to reach me you can shoot me an email at [hi@lincolnroth.com](mailto:hi@lincolnroth.com) or message me through my [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincoln-roth/)
