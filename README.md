### Howdy y'all ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Lincoln!

I'm currently a Firmware Engineer at [Second Order Effects](https://soeffects.com/), an engineering consulting firm that helps many clients across the deep tech space.

I've previously worked for ASML as a mechantronics intern and [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython) through the MLH Fellowship.

I studied Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and have years of experience in the mechatronics/hardware development space covering mechanical, electrical, firmware and software engineering.
Here are some of the cool things I've built and worked on:
- Space-rated SSDs for satellites
- Diagnostic systems for fusion reactors
- Motor controllers for space robots
- HITL's for rocket engine controllers
- Test systems for 18650 battery binning
- Optical diagnostics medical device prototype
- Vibration diagnostics on robot arms used in semiconductor manufacturing
- Small-scale simulation environment for self driving cars
- CUDA accelerated CFD for flapping robot simulations
- Live coding for microcontrollers over BLE
- Solar Powered Race Car - I was the Mechanical lead for my universities solar car team
- Autonomous firefighting robots
- 3D-Printed 3D-Printer (based on an h-bot style kinematics platform)
- custom high torque density actuators for a quadruped (that part is still in progress)
- Strobrscope - iOS app that uses a dynamically-varied framerate to visibly measure frequency
- many many robot arms, electric vehicles, random tiny projects i've forgotten about
- Checkout even more here on github or at my website [here](https://lincolnroth.com) (work in progress). 

I'm always interested in new opportunities and always down to chat/talk/build/whatever, so if you want to reach me you can shoot me an email at [hi@lincolnroth.com](mailto:hi@lincolnroth.com) or message me through my [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincoln-roth/)
